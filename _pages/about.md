<a href='#'>Hello, 你好, Bonjour, こんにちは, 안녕하세요!</a>
 
My name is Ningna Wang (/niŋ-na/ /wɔŋ/, 王宁娜 in Chinese). I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Graphics Lab at the University of Texas at Dallas. Under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaohu Guo](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~xguo/), my research focuses on geometric modeling. My current research direction is [medial axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_axis) computation and its application. I would love to explore new representations and new algorithms to make processing geometric data more easily and efficiently. 

<!-- My work seeks new algorithms and new representations to make computing with geometric data easy, efficient, and reliable. -->

<!-- I would love to explore more applications of triangle meshes and tetrahedral meshes. -->

Prior to UTD, I worked as a [Senior Software Developer](https://careers.booking.com/teams/engineering/) at [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/), Amsterdam, Netherlands, where I was responsible for the development of hotel availability distributed search system that handles thousands of requests per second. And I obtained the [M.S. in Computer Science](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) (CMU) and the [B.S. in Mathematics](https://math.jlu.edu.cn/English/About_Us/Introduction.htm) from [Jilin University](https://math.jlu.edu.cn/English/Home.htm) (JLU).


<!-- **I am seeking for an internship opportunity in 2023/2024 ([CV](https://ningnawang.github.io/assets/pdf/cv_ningnawang.pdf), <a href="mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}" title="email">Email</a>)**

<!-- My Chinese name is 王宁娜. The closest pronunciation of my name in English is /niŋ-na/ /wɔŋ/.) -->


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
