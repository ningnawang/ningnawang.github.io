<a href='#'>Hello, 你好, Bonjour, こんにちは, 안녕하세요!</a>
 
My name is Ningna Wang (/niŋ-na/ /wɔŋ/, 王宁娜 in Chinese). I am an incoming Postdoctoral Research Scientist at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), where I will be working with Prof. [Silvia Sellán](https://www.silviasellan.com/). My research focuses on geometric modeling, with an emphasis on developing new representations and algorithms that make geometric data processing more efficient and effective.

I received my [Ph.D. in Computer Science](https://cs.utdallas.edu/) from [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/), advised by Prof. [Xiaohu Guo](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~xguo/). Before my Ph.D., I worked as a [Senior Software Developer](https://careers.booking.com/teams/engineering/) at [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/) in Amsterdam, where I contributed to the development of a large-scale distributed search system for hotel availability, handling thousands of requests per second.
