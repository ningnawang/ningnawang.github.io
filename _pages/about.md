<a href='#'>Hello, 你好, Bonjour, こんにちは, 안녕하세요!</a>
 
My name is Ningna Wang (/niŋ-na/ /wɔŋ/, 王宁娜 in Chinese). I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Graphics Lab at the University of Texas at Dallas. Under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaohu Guo](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~xguo/), my research focuses on geometric modeling. My current research direction is [medial axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_axis) computation and its application. I would love to explore new representations and new algorithms to make processing geometric data more easily and efficiently. 

Prior to UTD, I worked as a [Senior Software Developer](https://careers.booking.com/teams/engineering/) at [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/), Amsterdam, Netherlands, where I was responsible for the development of hotel availability distributed search system that handles thousands of requests per second. I obtained the [M.S. in Computer Science](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) (CMU) and the [B.S. in Mathematics](https://math.jlu.edu.cn/English/About_Us/Introduction.htm) from [Jilin University](https://math.jlu.edu.cn/English/Home.htm) (JLU).
